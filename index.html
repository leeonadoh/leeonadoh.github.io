  <h1 class="nocount">Reports for Project Courses</h1>

  <p>
    During my last year of my bachelors at UTSC, I had the amazing oppourtunity
    of being enrolled into two research project courses. With an unhealthy
    interest in computer graphics, I decided to use the eight months that these
    two courses offered to implement my own path tracer. Below, you'll find
    the final reports for both courses.
